# Flying High with Avions ✈️



## How It All Began

When I first joined **Avions**, I never imagined the journey would take me this far—into the skies, across competitions, and deep into hands-on engineering. As someone passionate about innovation and real-world applications of technology, becoming a part of Avions, our college's aerospace and drone tech club, was a game-changer.

## Getting Involved with the Team

My involvement began with curiosity, attending weekly sessions where we dissected the mechanics of drones, discussed aerodynamics, and got our hands dirty with hardware. Soon, I was contributing to actual projects—building, testing, and even flying drones designed by our team. Working on these projects gave me a unique understanding of electronics, flight systems, and coding that I couldn’t have learned just in a classroom.

## Leading the Autonomous Drone Project

One of my proudest moments was leading the software and communication systems for a fully autonomous drone. Our drone could take off, reach a destination, drop a payload, and return—all without human intervention. I handled the integration between the **Pixhawk flight controller**, **Raspberry Pi**, and the custom ground station software that allowed us to monitor and control the drone remotely. This was part of a broader mission to solve real-world logistics problems using UAVs.



## More Than Just Engineering

Being part of Avions isn't just about tech—it's about teamwork, vision, and pushing boundaries. Whether it's preparing for competitions, mentoring juniors, or brainstorming wild ideas at 2 AM, this club has become a huge part of my college life.
